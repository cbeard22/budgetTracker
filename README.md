Budget Tracker is a web application used to track your expenses over time to compare your spending habits. 

[Live Site!](https://fierce-eyrie-44884.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

- The creation of this project was motivated by wanting to allow the user to track their expeses so they can manage their bank account more easily. The user can add an expense online and offline. When the user then goes back online the data that was stored is now logged in the application and saved.
